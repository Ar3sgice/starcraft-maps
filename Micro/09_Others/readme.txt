8882's micromappack readme
Due to popular demand I created a map pack with most of my micro maps (I didnt include some maps, especially from folders 'beta' and 'crap').
The pack contains 202 maps, from my private collection, google and few other packs. Thanks to few people who gave me some of their maps (unfortuantely I had all of them :D ).
The maps are sorted, so you wont have to look for ones with specific matchup or confuse single player maps with multiplayer ones etc. However some maps are good and some suck (mostly because of poor balance), so if you dont like them try another one.
I advise you to try:
-zvt-clan ps control map and zt&tz train
-zvp-MicroTrainingZvP0.95.scx  and micro_ZvP2_hydra_storm.scm (I called it hydra storm, because most of the rounds include zeal/HT vs hydras)
-zvz-8882's micro_ZvZ_LT-gamei_beta37p.scx :D
-tvp-TvP Micro Training - BETA v.scx and TvP_fizban.scm (probably made by fizban)
Most of the 1v1mixed maps are good, but probably the best are: MicroTrainERangedMeleeBeta.scx
and (7)AdvMicroWars.scx
I advise you to try 2v2(improved)_clock.scx, if you want to play 2v2.
For 3v3 the best maps are Micro_Traning_3vs3.scx and 1-Micro-Training-6-Players.scm. You can also try one of team micro arenas (I dont collect them, just posted some BETTER versions).
I encourage you to try LimYohWan's Marine Control I and II, if you like it try the map made by my friend Munkeys. 
Most maps in the one_or_more_vs_comps folder are good, especially the ones with korean names (hopefully the zip wont screw them up). 
If you're bored you can watch one of the three replays, in one you can see boxer killing an enemy camp with goliath and dropship.
The single player maps you should definitely try are:
BaDa)MicroControl-Trn11Hyp.scx (thanks for bada)ggoma for the map), microterr v1.0.scx, training_terran.scx, tank-dropship.scm, laboratory.scx (Gabe. thank you for the map and replay), trainzvreaver.scm (this one is tricky, I wonder if you can do it the first time you play it). Most of them are for terran, but there are maps for other races too. 
I also added a folder called skill_test with maps, on which players play melee games versus computers with some advantage/improved AI. 
I also attach (8)The Hunters 8x.scm where you can train bot micro and macro for all races. The units move ~7times faster and DONT attack so you have to attack move. The map is a bit buggy, but quite entertaining.

If you have any map not included in this pack, please send it to me - my email adress is:
fledgeling@poczta.onet.pl 
If you are korean DONT kick me from games beacuse I dont have hanstar, I use the account 8882 on all servers except for asia - someone has stolen the account 8882, so I use the id's fledgeling and slimyohwan.

Enjoy,
8882
